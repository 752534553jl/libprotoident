Description: development headers for the libprotoident library
 This package contains development headers and other ancillary files for
 the libprotoident library.
 .
 libprotoident is a library that can perform traffic classification
 on each network flow observed via a packet capture process (including
 pcap trace files and many common live packet capture approaches).
 The classification is performed by examining the packet headers and
 first four bytes of application payload only, so can be used in
 environments where full payload capture is not possible.
 .
 libprotoident is developed by the WAND Network Research Group at Waikato
 University in New Zealand.

Description: example utilities that make use of the libprotoident library
 libprotoident is a library that can perform network traffic classification
 using minimal application payload. These tools are provided as working
 demonstrations of libprotoident and can be used to perform simple analytic
 tasks (i.e. identify flows belonging to a specific application).
